EvasiveRectangle 5.0 - The Enemy AI Update

-----Changelog-----
* Added a new behavior for enemies that causes them to wander when the 
  player is not on the same platform
* Depending on whether or not the player is above or below an enemy they 
  may stay on their current platform 
* Enemies will attempt to jump to platforms in reach above them if the player 
  is on higher ground than them
* The jump method can now be used for any entity
* Moved several player specific global variables into the player object
* Moved some of the groundCheck protocol to the updatePlayer method
* Updated loop syntax in most cases
* Widened map

-----BackLog-----
* Add a new type of enemy
	- potentially a boss enemy that only spawns later
	- may need a new method or a re-work of the Enemy method
	  that allows for more flexible enemy design
* Change how scoring works or potentially add a new way to obtain score
* Add a main menu
* Create and implement a procedurally generating tile map
	- would erase offscreen enemies and tiles and spawn in new ones
* Adjust player/Enemy movement speed to be less snappy
